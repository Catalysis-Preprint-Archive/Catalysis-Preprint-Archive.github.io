  abstract =	 "Abstract We performed a series of density functional
theory calculations of dissociative oxygen adsorption on fcc metals
and their corresponding rocksalt monoxides to elucidate the
relationship between the oxide electronic structure and its
corresponding reactivity. We decomposed the dissociative adsorption
energy of oxygen on an oxide surface into a sum of the adsorption
energy on the metal and a change in adsorption energy caused by both
expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We were able to identify the key
features of the electronic structure that explains the trends in
adsorption energies on 3d transition metal monoxide surfaces. ",
